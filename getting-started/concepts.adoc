= Common Concepts and terminology

== Terminology

Fraction:: A well-defined collection of capabilities to add.  In some cases, a _fraction_ maps directly to a _subsystem_ from WildFly, but in other cases (e.g. <<fake/../advanced/jolokia.adoc#,Jolokia>>) a fraction may involve different functionality.

Uberjar:: A self-contained, executable Java archive. In the case of WildFly Swarm uberjars, it is a single `.jar` file containing your application, the portions of WildFly required to support it, an internal Maven repository of dependencies, plus a shim to bootstrap it all.

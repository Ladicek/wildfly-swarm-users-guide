= Common Concepts and terminology

== Terminology

Fraction:: A well-defined collection of capabilities to add.  
In some cases, a _fraction_ maps directly to a _subsystem_ 
from WildFly, but in other cases (e.g. <<fake/../advanced/jolokia.adoc#,Jolokia>>) a 
fraction may involve different functionality.

Uberjar:: A self-contained, executable Java archive. In the case of 
WildFly Swarm uberjars, it is a single `.jar` file containing your 
application, the portions of WildFly required to support it, an 
internal Maven repository of dependencies, plus a shim to bootstrap it all.

Hollow Uberjar:: A self-contained, executable Java archive that contains
no application code.  Somewhat contradictory term. It is a container
capable of deploying a particular type of application.

Default Deployment:: The primary application artifact created
by your Maven or Gradle build. This may be a `.war` in many cases
or a `.jar`, depending on the `<packaging>` in your `pom.xml`

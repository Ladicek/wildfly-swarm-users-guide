= WAR Packaging

If you have an existing WAR-based application, you can construct a self-contained `_myapp_-swarm.jar` from it with ease. By using the plugin of your choice (Maven or Gradle), the resulting uberjar will contain your application along with enough of the application-server to support it.

When building a WAR-based application, you currently can not supply a `main(...)` method to launch it.

== Maven

For a Maven project, you already have a `pom.xml` with

    <packaging>war</packaging>

Simply add configuration for the `wildfly-swarm-plugin`:

[source,xml]
----
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
      <artifactId>wildfly-swarm-plugin</artifactId>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
----

When you perform a typical Maven build using `mvn package`, your `target` directory will include a `_myapp_-swarm.jar` version of your application.

If you don't specify any WildFly Swarm fractions as dependencies, the maven plugin will auto-detect the fractions your application needs. See the <<tooling/maven-plugin#,Maven chapter>> for more details.

This artifact can then be executed using:

    java -jar ./target/myapp-swarm.jar

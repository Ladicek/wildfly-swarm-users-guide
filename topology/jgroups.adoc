== Topology using JGroups

By including the `topology-jgroups` dependency in your application, and optionally configuring the `jgroups` fraction, all of your WildFly Swarm instances can discover one another without having to run any additional servers.  The JGroups topology management infrastructure is server-less and is peer-to-peer in mosts cases.

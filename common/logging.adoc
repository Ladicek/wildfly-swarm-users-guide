== Logging

Logging is supported by WildFly Swarm using the typical JBoss-Logging systems. By default, logging occurs to the console. Advanced configuration can adjust the amount of information logged and where the log ends up (files or console or other locations).

=== Including Logging Capabilities

Several of the higher-order fractions include logging by default. If you need to include it explicitly, though, you may use the following Maven coordinates.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>logging</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

=== Configuration

Including the above dependency will automatically configure reasonable INFO-level logging to the console. You can control the logging level with the `swarm.logging` sysprop: `-Dswarm.logging=DEBUG`.

If you wish to perform more advanced configuration, please see the
http://wildfly-swarm.github.io/wildfly-swarm/{{book.versions.swarm}}/apidocs/org/wildfly/swarm/config/logging/package-summary.html[JavaDocs for the Logging API].

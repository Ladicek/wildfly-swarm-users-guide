= Pre-built Servers

The WildFly Swarm project has pre-built some standalone servers. The source for these reside in the https://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-servers[WildFly Swarm Servers repository].


== Keycloak Server

The WildFly Swarm project has built a standalone uberjar for running Keycloak Server.

It's Maven coordinates are:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm.servers</groupId>
  <artifactId>keycloak</artifactId>
  <classifier>swarm</classifier>
</dependency>
----

Download or otherwise obtain the `-swarm.jar` and simply execute it as any other service created with WildFly Swarm.

[source]
----
java -jar keycloak-{{book.versions.swarm}}-swarm.jar
----

== Swagger UI Server
Swagger UI is a dependency-free collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate documentation and sandbox from a Swagger-compliant API. WildFly Swarm provides an easily deployable and customizable version of this application.

It's maven coordinates are:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm.servers</groupId>
  <artifactId>swagger-ui</artifactId>
  <classifier>swarm</classifier>
</dependency>
----

Download the `-swarm.jar` and execute it with the `java` command.

[source]
----
$ java -jar swarm-ui-{{book.versions.swarm}}-swarm.jar
----

You can customize any of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript or image assets provided by the server by specifying these on the command line. The command line will accept a path to a `jar` or `war` file on disk, a path to a directory on disk containing your web resources, or maven coordinates to a `jar` file.

The `jar` file provided (or the directory on disk) will be overlaid on to the resources provided by `swagger-ui`. For example, to customize the main page, provide an `index.html` file at the root of the `jar` or `war` file, or in the top level of the directory provided.

$ jar tvf my-custom-project.jar

    312 Mon Feb 01 11:41:58 EST 2016 index.html

$ java -jar swarm-ui-{{book.versions.swarm}}-swarm.jar ./my-custom-resources.jar
----

This will cause the `index.html` file provided in `my-custom-resources.jar` to be served instead of the default provided by `swagger-ui`.

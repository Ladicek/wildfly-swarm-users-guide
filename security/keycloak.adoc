= Single Sign On using Keycloak

Keycloak is an authentication and authorization server created by JBoss. It runs separate from any particular application. It acts as the primary authentication/authorization database of record and can also provide social-login capabilities.

WildFly Swarm provides easy integration with Keycloak.

Currently, WildFly Swarm supports version {{book.versions.keycloak}}.

== Adding Keycloak support

To bring Keycloak integration to your application, you need the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>keycloak</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Once this is added, you can use the `Secured` archive type to secure your application.  The easiest way to integrate is by providing a `keycloak.json` file in your application classpath and use `.as(Secured.class)`.

[source,java]
----
JAXRSArchive deployment = ShrinkWrap.create(JAXRSArchive.class);
deployment.as(Secured.class);
----

By default, this only adds support, but not a requirement, on Keycloak. Anonymous users can still access the entire application.  If they are authenticated, the `SecurityContext` will be populated with the user's information.

== Protecting your application

You can also protect various aspects of your application after using `.as(Secured.class)` by chaining calls to `.protect(_path_)`

[source,java]
----
deployment.as(Secured.class)
  .protect( "/some-resource" )
    .withMethod( "GET" )
    .withRoles( "admin" );
----
